      <h1>Know more about Namling</h1>
      <p>üëã Kuzu Zangpo! My name is Sangay Namling Yoezer, and I am currently pursuing 
        a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Education (IT). My academic journey is all about 
        bridging technology and teaching by learning how to code, break things 
        (on purpose, sometimes accidentally), and then explain it all in a way 
        that doesn‚Äôt make people run away. I am fascinated by anything that makes 
        me think deeply and critically; whether it‚Äôs a tricky programming concept 
        or a thought-provoking discussion, I enjoy challenges that push me to look 
        at things from multiple perspectives.</p>

      <p>Outside the classroom and computer screen, I am someone who believes in 
        balancing the logical with the creative. In my leisure time, I sketch, 
        capturing ideas and moments on paper, and I often find myself watching 
        documentaries that expand how I see the world. Music is also an essential 
        part of my day. I listen to all kinds of songs, not tied to a single genre, 
        because I feel every tune has its own story to tell. On top of that, 
        I love photography and video-making, freezing little pieces of life in 
        frames and sometimes stitching them into short stories.</p>

      <p>Family plays a big role in who I am. I come from a family of four siblings,
         with three sisters and me as the only son, which basically makes me both the 
         ‚Äúprince‚Äù and the ‚Äúoccasional errand boy‚Äù of the household. We live in an 
         extended family home, and that environment has shaped me into someone who 
         values togetherness, adaptability, and humor in everyday life.</p>
         
      <p>If I had to sum myself up, I would say I am an introverted learner who‚Äôs endlessly 
        curious, a creative who enjoys capturing and creating, and a teacher-in-training 
        who finds joy in helping others grow. And of course, I try to sprinkle in a little 
        humor along the way because life‚Äôs too short not to laugh at yourself while debugging 
        both code and reality</p>
